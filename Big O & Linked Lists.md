# Big O

- Big O is basically a mathmatical way to represent the efficiency and complexity of a function, you can utilize it to judge if the your approach is best or not.

- you can use it for time complexity and space complexity.

- the best apprach being the constant O(1), and the worst being the factorial O(n!).

# Linked list

- Linked list is a type of data structure which consists of a base unit called node and pointers connecting nodes with each other.

- you can dp multiple operations in a data structure like: Traversing, Searching, Inserting, Deleting, etc.

## Why would you use linked list over other types of data structures?

- A linked list is a dynamic arrangement so it can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating memory.

- In the Linked list, efficient memory utilization can be achieved since the size of the linked list increase or decrease at run time so there is no memory wastage and there is no need to pre-allocate the memory.

- Insertion and deletion operations are quite easier in the linked list.
