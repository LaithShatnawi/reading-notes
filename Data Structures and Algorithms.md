# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Questions:

### 1.What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

Considering the time complexity of the operations you'll perform on the data structure is one of the most important aspects.

### 2.How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

We need to specify the Base Case and the Recursive Step
